starting at index.html you can click the TMS text top left corner is your home button . I have a drop down bar for login and sign up as well as a searchbar in the nav . I had tried to make the cards have complete and not complete buttons
but for whatever the reason the carousel did not like it so I scrapped it . The cards have pictures to represent cleaning tasks . The new task button will allow you to go to new task page which only has a title and description input. 
I tried too use javascript too add the new tasks into the carousel but I couldnt get it to work . 
the login and sign up page are pretty similar I was gonna make them be on the same page however I couldnt get the containers too replace one another depending on section so I left as is cause it doesnt look bad .
